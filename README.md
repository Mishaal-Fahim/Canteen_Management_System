# CANTEEN MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

## Description
The Canteen Management System is a Python-based project that features a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) built using the Tkinter library. It is integrated with a MySQL database for efficient management of data, ensuring secure handling of menu items, orders, and financial information. The system is designed to enhance the canteen experience for both shopkeepers and students.

## Key Features

### Shopkeeper Features:

#### Menu Management:
The system provides a user-friendly interface for managing menu items, allowing shopkeepers to add, remove, or modify items as needed. Changes to menu items and prices are updated in real-time, ensuring that students always see the most current information. Items can be categorized into groups such as beverages, snacks, fast food, and chocolates for better organization and easier access.

#### Order Processing:
A secure system is available for viewing, processing, and fulfilling student orders. Shopkeepers can efficiently manage incoming orders and mark them as fulfilled once they are completed, ensuring accurate and timely service.

#### Financial Management:
The system tracks sales with detailed records of costs, revenue, and profits, providing shopkeepers with comprehensive financial insights. Financial data is stored securely and is accessible only to authorized shopkeepers, maintaining data integrity and confidentiality.

### Student Features:

#### Menu Browsing:
Students can interact with a user-friendly interface to view menu items along with their descriptions and prices. The system includes features to filter or search items by category, and it provides real-time updates to ensure that students see the latest menu offerings.

#### Order Placement and Billing:
A secure system allows students to log in, select items, and place orders with ease. Before finalizing their orders, students receive a detailed billing summary to ensure transparency and accuracy.

#### Account Management:
Students can securely log in using system-generated passwords, which must be updated upon first login. The system allows students to view past orders and manage their account details securely, ensuring a seamless and secure user experience.

## How to use:
First download the images then install the required libraries by executing pip install requests and pillow (or PIL). After installing these libraries, you can run the code to incorporate new items into the database and update the menu. You can find the shopkeeper ID and password in the code, but for convenience, I am including it here as well.
SHOPKEEPER ID: 676377 AND SHOPKEEPER PASSWORD: ubit2468
